Our roofing and electrical crews worked 15 days straight to complete Phase 2, backed by the relentless support of our sales, engineering, and project management teams. This was a full-team effort, start to finish. 💪 It’s officially up and running — and it’s just the beginning. We’re bringing solar resilience to the Caribbean one rooftop at a time. 🎥 Subscribe on YouTube — the full project video is dropping soon.",
